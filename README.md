<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center">

</p>

We created SimpleTeam in order to help everyone keeping their to-do list as dynamic, compact and efficiently as possible, unimportant if you are only one, or maybe a whole team of many people, there is enough space for everyone!

Interested? Here are some special things about SimpleTeam:
* Create a team for your own organisation in order to manage your own- and others to-dos
* Connect your to-do lists between multiple devices so that you are always aware of the next tasks
* Chat with others in your organisation and inform yourself for up-coming tasks

<!-- Of course, no ones template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements. -->

### Built With

With the intention, to get a wide platform support we built our whole GUI with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- ## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```JS
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ``` -->



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If you are on your own, it's an efficient to-do manager. Synchronize your tasks between multiple devices and stay always up-to-date.

Maybe you have a whole team with lots of things to manage - no problem - there are many functions implemented to create a team, invite your teammembers, manage their to-dos and also their organizational rights.
